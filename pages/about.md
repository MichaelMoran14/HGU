## About the Collection
This project emerged out of conversations I had with Dr. Jeff Ringer regarding the theoretical application of Vernacular religious creativity to a social movement analysis. The He Gets Us campaign was chosen as it is both the subject of debate and contention and an iteresting intersection of conservative Evangelicalism and the creative translations that happen in individual articulations of faith. Collection builder, in this case, has been used to organize the artifacts and to make searchable the codes identified in analysis. The site itself serves as a final project for Dr. Hilary Havens' digital humanities class, Engl 595, at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 
Below you can find same of the Communalytic data which I am still in the process of downloading and analyzing. The communalytic data will serve as the other side of the individual articulation issue present in theories of vernacular creativity. That is, sentiment analysis will serve as the broad data that informs my analysis of the effectiveness of VRC strategies in social movements, and the effectiveness of the HGU campaign to its multiple audiences.
