## About the Collection
This project emerged out of conversations I had with Dr. Jeff Ringer regarding the theoretical application of Vernacular religious creativity to a social movement analysis. The He Gets Us campaign was chosen as it is both the subject of debate and contention and an iteresting intersection of conservative Evangelicalism and the creative translations that happen in individual articulations of faith. Collection builder, in this case, has been used to organize the artifacts and to make searchable the codes identified in analysis. The site itself serves as a final project for Dr. Hilary Havens' digital humanities class, Engl 595, at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

Below you can find same of the Communalytic data which I am still in the process of downloading and analyzing. The communalytic data will serve as the other side of the individual articulation issue present in theories of vernacular creativity. That is, sentiment analysis will serve as the broad data that informs my analysis of the effectiveness of VRC strategies in social movements, and the effectiveness of the HGU campaign to its multiple audiences. For more info, I will also include a rough transcript of my presentations explaining this project in the background section.

## Background

This is a transcript of a presentation I gave for my research methods class describing the project broadly. Please excuse typos as this was spoken and I've had minimal time to edit it for clarity. This does not explicitly detail my specific methodology in using Collection Builder or Communalytic, but should serve as an okay background for the general ideas and exigence: 

My project is about the He Gets Us evangelical ad campaign famously they advertised at the Super bowl. This project really emerged out of when I took Jeff’s class in undergrad. I was being my usual self in his class, and he was presenting his research on Vernacular Religious Creativity, and I just decided to be disruptive, I guess. I said you know this is this is fine and good, but how do you apply this outside the context of individual interviews with a few undergraduate students? How do you apply this to an analysis of a social movement, for example? How do you really apply this to a broader analysis outside of a few evangelical students?  Jeff said, “Well that's a good question what do you mean by that can you give an example?” So, I mentioned this he gets us Super Bowl ad. Jeff said “that's a good question you should write a paper on them. I can send you some sources.” He sent me some sources and I didn't write the paper for like 2 years.

Ringer’s work is on vernacular religious creativity which he defines as “an active ongoing process whereby religious believers adapt or adjust their beliefs in relation to their sociocultural context” (Ringer 24). Which effectively looks like when students or when people articulate their beliefs to a non-religious audience it effectively changes what they believe. You can see them kind of moving towards a more open or liberal worldview. He also advocates for deliberative discourse and sees this as a positive means. So, you could see why Ringer approaches this by doing long form interviews with several undergraduate students, which prompted my question about a broader analysis.

Now we get to the He Gets Us campaign. For those who did not watch the Super bowl the last two years, I encourage you to watch some of the videos. Basically, all of the ads have this same format and tone. A kind of self-righteous tone, but using images interspersed with color that juxtapose political tension with human kindness. There are some really interesting choices being made in these ads. 

As you can see, they're all very short. But basically, it's a campaign where they got a bunch of money, and they did some research to try to solve that church attendance is dropping off. People identifying with different religious groups as falling off, but young people at least are still very open to the idea of a historical human Jesus. Jesus as a story. Jesus a narrative. They're open to spiritualism, and HGU thought “well let's take all this money and let's just advocate for that to try to move people towards the church.” Famously in the 2023 Super Bowl (this all started in 2022) they spent $50 million to run an ad which then, in turn, prompted approximately 50 million think pieces from different news institutions, YouTube videos, Substacks with everyone titling their article, “The truth behind he gets us.” This nefarious truth that they were getting to is that it is funded by a bunch of billionaire evangelical far right Christians who also fund a lot of other horrible things. It also used to be managed by a group called The Servant Foundation and they've since switched because they got a bunch of backlash for being affiliated with those people. But the more substantive critique came from the University of Chicago divinity school wrote a piece about how he gets us campaign is painting a false moral equivalency between protesters and cops. The usual well both sides are extreme argument isn't really taken well even in light of Jesus. However, it seems this article has been taken down. 

So, the research questions that have emerged out of this. It's kind of the original thing that I had to ask Ringer. How does the idea of a vernacular religious creativity apply to a broad social movement and then just the title of the presentation broadly what are the goals what are the outcomes or the strategies? Just kind of a basic rhetorical analysis.

So, in order to do this, I've done social media analysis. I'm using communalytic to look at  toxicity analysis and sentiment analysis under the most viewed videos on the He Gets Us YouTube channel. My goal for this project right now is to combine the sentiments and my assumption of what's going on with what would turn into long form interviews with members of the evangelical community and outside the evangelical community regarding these ads. At this point social media analysis communalytic the free version only offers YouTube videos and Reddit analysis and considering the typical stereotypes of the Reddit atheist, it was not exactly a representative or interesting sample to look at. But I looked at three of the major YouTube videos and some interesting trends emerged: first and foremost being that the plurality of sentiment on all three of the videos I looked at (which are three of the most viewed videos on the channel including the one that was shown at the last Super Bowl) was actually positive. I downloaded the comments on a CSV file in a spreadsheet and I looked at it and there are issues with what the algorithms sort as toxic or not, like they were sorting atheist as a toxic term which I I'm not good enough at coding, nor do I know enough about who is doing this to really take a guess on why that would be. But there are there are similar issues with like what constitutes profanity versus extreme profanity or hate speech. Generally, I mean I'm looking at 1000 samples under each video and I feel like this is a pretty representative sample to say anywhere from 40 to 50% of the sentiment according to three different algorithms is positive which is surprising considering all of the think pieces and discourse around this. 

When I look at what the major news outlets are saying generally the liberal ones all basically say the same thing which is to be dismissive and point out hypocrisy. Conservatives have a meltdown about it. There's a Fox News panel that has since been taken down off of YouTube where people were yelling at each other, Glenn Beck's channel which for no reason has about like 1.6 million subscribers he did like a 15 minute video about how great this ad campaign is, which is shocking, and then Charlie Kirk responded to him and talked about how much of an idiot he is and how horrible the ads are, and how much better they could be. It goes on and on like this. One of the interesting articles I found one of the few peer reviewed articles that I found actually discussing this there's almost none a lot of like undergraduate theses which maybe doesn't bode well for my paper but there was one peer reviewed article from the evangelical missiological society where they were basically saying he gets us as bad because they're appealing to the Jesus of Gandhi, which I don't exactly know where they're going with that argument but sure is interesting anyway the trend that has emerged. 

In my observations and through the social media analysis is that liberal people and well liberal people and atheist people are generally apathetic towards the campaign. Reddit atheists and such can be very, you know, lean heavy on the hypocrisy, and how these people have to have some nefarious evil goals at the end, but otherwise from non-Christians this is not generally seen as an evil campaign. Here's my assumption here's my preliminary finding this is a campaign created thought of created by and orchestrated through Christian people, using Christian evangelical discourse, that only appeals to other people within that community. So, what ends up happening is that they are moving Christian evangelicals towards, with this you know very typical positionality of Jesus argument, they're moving Christians to a more liberal position and not really affecting the people outside their community. 

Then we have to look at the data that complicates some of this and behind a lot of it so an interview given by a man who described himself as a theological consultant for that he gets us campaign he talked about how they have somewhere between 600,000 and 700,000 people signed up for their weekly Bible reading group, and when he was pressed on how do you know that these are people who are signing up who were not in the church already, he said “well I don't. We do not take demographic data.” Which there are plenty of good reasons for them to do that. They don't want to have a bunch of barriers to entry that kind of goes against you know evangelizing. But it kind of leaves the marketing firm managing this, and maybe doing an analysis, at a loss for how to actually look at this. This doesn't refute my preliminary findings through social media analysis, but what it does sort of reflect is a similar data collection issue which is the only way to identify evangelicals is through self-identification. which or early Pew Research from the last two years has found that evangelical Christians are one of the only groups religious groups in America that is growing not because people are finding Jesus but because people the association between conservative republican and evangelical Christian has become so strong that many people or identifying as evangelical Christians because they feel like they should and that has emerged in the data as several million people self-identifying more people self-identifying as evangelical Christians while the percentage of self-identified evangelical Christians who go to church has increased to 50% so now half of all Americans who identify as evangelical Christians don't go to church which very pretty much complicates my data collection so at this point I just have to kind of throw my hands up and ask you guys what am I supposed to do about this at the I think my early plan right now is to interview people who do identify that way and then see what trends emerge and like a long form discourse with them maybe multiple interviews like Jeff did um see if that reflects these findings or assumptions that I have about my early social media analysis but yeah I just I don't really know where to go from here luckily we don't actually have to do the paper for this class but you know if this turns into another work that I'm going to do then I might have some so hopefully you guys can help me out with this
