hguvid1,,-Eg_yrpjmlY&t=1s,,The Rebel,He Gets Us Youtube,2022,"Jesus knew how it felt like to be falsely judged. The government and religious authorities of Jesus’ day saw Jesus and his disciples as troublemakers, lawbreakers, and rebels. Jesus and his crew were eyed with suspicion whenever they entered a new city or walked down the street. Rumors and false accusations swirled. Everything they did was questioned or challenged. The truth is, they were rebels. They were challenging authority. But they were not criminals. They were rebels for peace. They challenged others to love everyone. This was a radical idea that the leaders of that time couldn’t see or wouldn’t embrace. But that didn’t stop Jesus or his followers. They did the right thing despite the misunderstanding and biases within their society.",Challenge; Righteousness; Social Movement; Translation; Positionality; Love,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Eg_yrpjmlY&t=1s,,,Video,English,,
hguvid2,,94BqlDQ-Ppo,,Foot Washing,He Gets Us Youtube,2024,"The night before he died, Jesus got his friends and followers together and washed their feet as a symbolic example of how they should humble themselves while dignifying and valuing others. How would our contentious world change if people, especially those with opposing ideologies, took off their shoes and washed each other’s feet?

hguvid3,,rUUG3aXWiA0,,Dinner Party,He Gets Us Youtube,2021,"Jesus was radically inclusive. His love movement ran counter to cultural norms and religious expectations of the day. He went out of his way to care for people whom society had rejected – from disabled people, to conquering military oppressors, to prostitutes. He befriended corrupt tax collectors and violent nationalists. He treated women as equals at a time when such behavior was unheard of, and he embraced people in historically oppressed races and ethnic communities. Many times his love was so radical that it even violated the law. Jesus invited all to participate in the love, but not everyone was interested. The powerful and the wealthy were often threatened by Jesus’ movement, because it always resisted systems of oppression. After all, many benefited from oppressing the poor, the sick, women, and even certain races that Jesus embraced throughout his activism. So, they didn’t just reject his invitation, they killed him for it. But in spite of their best efforts to silence the movement, Jesus’s message still resonates today. And its still radically inclusive. We’re all invited.",Translation; Inclusivity; Care; Service,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUUG3aXWiA0,,,Video,English,,

hguvid6,,33usZMpke3k,,"Learning to say ""I was wrong""",He Gets Us Youtube,2024,"Admitting when we’re wrong is incredibly difficult. It hurts our pride, it empties us. But Jesus praised humility. He said, “Blessed are the meek.” We talked to Mely about the tug-of-war between humility and pride—about balancing perfectionism and our own limitations. Mely discovered something that we think Jesus pointed to—that there is serious strength found in admitting weakness. It’s just not so easy to do because Jesus’ love is like a second language.

hguvid7,,DylIFHJacV4&t=1s,,Jesus and the Woman at the Well,He Gets Us Youtube,2024,"To her, Jesus was a man who was breaking all sorts of boundaries to talk to her. To him, it seems she was worthy of so much more respect and kindness than anyone ever showed her. It might not seem like much, but this unlikely conversation set the stage for Jesus to live out and share his message of radical love and selflessness and to invite the most unlikely of people to play a part in it all.",Race; Gender; Sexuality; Translation;,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DylIFHJacV4&t=1s,,,Video,English,,
hguvid8,,gWplgR3t_Ck,,"Learning to say ""I love you""",He Gets Us Youtube,2023,"Saying “I love you” and truly meaning it can be hard for so many reasons. Maybe it’s hard because you’re afraid to say something you don’t mean, or maybe it’s hard because to say those words is to make yourself more vulnerable than you’re willing to be. Either way, getting our hearts and our words to align is no small task, but we think doing just that is a big part of what it means to be pure in heart — one of the character traits Jesus calls blessed. It’s not easy, but we think it’s worth it, and Arno’s story is a testament to that. Jesus’ love is like a second language.

It can feel almost impossible. But Jesus taught that a merciful life is a flourishing one, so how can we take steps toward learning forgiveness even when it’s hard?

So, what was Jesus talking about when he said, “Blessed are those who mourn”? We sat down with Mona to talk about grief and goodbyes to see what she’s learned and how she’s grown from her own life experience. It’s a moving story and a testament to the power of learning to love the way Jesus did. His love is like a second language.

hguvid12,,YOcglZFlFM8,,Family Matters,He Gets Us Youtube,2023,"Jesus had strained relationships with his loved ones.

hguvid15,,hcmVa8uNu7k,,Love is Louder,He Gets Us Youtube,2023,"Listening to the world around us, we couldn’t help but come to the conclusion that the volume is rising day by day, and we’ve noticed that most of what gets amplified—most of the stuff loud enough to be heard—is rife with hate, anger, and discontentment. And when hate gets amplified, too often we try to drown it out with even louder hate from a different perspective. It’s a vicious cycle, and it’s one Jesus dealt with 2000 years ago. But Jesus didn’t add to the noise, he responded to it with quiet and deliberate acts of love, and we’re still talking about it 2000 years later. Why? Because love is louder.",Love; Division; Civility; ,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcmVa8uNu7k,,,Video,English,,

There was no safety for them in their homeland, so the only option was to seek foreign soil. This was the reality for Mary, Joseph, and a very young Jesus. When King Herod ordered all the male children 2 years old or younger to be killed, Mary and Joseph had no other option. They fled to Egypt.

hguvid18,,d-lcLDvR8mc,,The Physician,He Gets Us Youtube,2022,"Jesus had great compassion. Everywhere he went, he sought to alleviate suffering. He ministered to the sick, injured, and outcasts. In those days, people who were afflicted with leprosy were isolated in leper colonies. While others shunned them, Jesus treated and assisted them. He was a healer, both of body and spirit. Jesus didn’t hold back his feelings. He cared. He mourned. He wept. Through his example, we can learn how to be more caring and compassionate to everyone around us. Like Jesus, we can seek ways to ease others’ burdens and lift them up physically and emotionally. Small acts of kindness and sincere words of sympathy can make a huge difference to someone that is in need of compassion.”",Positionality; Care; Pandemic; Isolation; ,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-lcLDvR8mc,,,Video,English,,
hguvid19,,iPsp0jc3K8Y,,The Birth,He Gets Us Youtube,2021,"This is a story about people jumping to conclusions and judging others without grace or mercy. And it’s also a story of incredible grace and forgiveness. Mary was a teenager dealing with an unplanned pregnancy. Just imagine what this young girl must have felt. Imagine her telling her parents she was pregnant. What would they think? And what would the rest of her community say? She would undoubtedly be judged harshly by everyone she knew. She would be called names. She would have brought shame on her family because she wasn’t married yet. Even worse — her boyfriend wasn’t even the father. This sort of thing wasn’t just taboo in their culture, it was against the law. Joseph knew the baby couldn’t possibly be his. He hadn’t ever slept with her. He would have been heartbroken. He forgave her for what he could only imagine was a total betrayal. After he forgave her, Joseph had a dream and a vision that changed his mind. He decided to marry her and raise the child as his own. Imagine his experience. He no doubt had to defend his new bride from people who judged her — people who didn’t know the whole story. Imagine how many of his friends and family would try to talk him out of devoting himself to this seemingly untrustworthy young girl. But in spite of all of these circumstances, and in spite of all the people who judged them, they were committed to one another and to their son, who would go on to start a radical movement of grace, forgiveness, and love that would change the world.",Sexuality; Gender; Marriage; Love; Positionailty; Healthcare; Translation;,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPsp0jc3K8Y,,,Video,English,,
